Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

I have mixed feelings on the cell phone law-- on one hand, it may help some students focus better which might lead to those students having better grades but it'll also lead to several issues with certain schoolwork because many students rely on their phones to do research for projects due to nearly every single site being restricted. For example, last year I did an english project on a topic that would've gotten flagged had I searched it on the computer so I had to do all the research on my phone lest I get pulled out of class like the other kids who picked the same project topic as me and tried to do their research on the chromebooks. The phone law, in my opinion, is pretty inutile in terms of actually helping students; It's likely it's going to just make students lives harder and force them to do all projects and research-based schoolwork fully at home.

Computer science can be valuable in the fashion industry by giving creators the ability to create 3D models of their design and helping them fully put their ideas to paper (or screen). The video shows designers being able to mix together clothing items from several different pictures to create one full outfit, this helps workers in fashion by giving them more creative ways to create designs. This could especially help people who aren't very good at coming up with an original design on the spot but are good at mix-matching and building off of other clothes- if they do that in fashion design?? In short, computer science can help designers and others in the fashion industry create designs easily and gives them a bit more creative freedom.

I don't think a virtual store where you can actually earn money is a very great idea. Social interaction is a core part of the human experienc; an actual job on a kids video game will likely limit peoples social well-being, especially if they treat it like an actual job and rarely every get out of their house. Jobs are where most peoples social interactions come from, while many of those are bad, people often make friends at their workplace you can't really do that on an online game (assuming it functions just as roblox does) There would be some interaction there but only via the roblox chat. In summary, A virtual story where you can actually recieve payment may not go extremely well as it'll affect peoples social interaction.

I don't know what 6,7 means; I heard people constantly shouting it, but I found it really annoying so I ignored it and didn't bother learning the actual meaning.

If i were in charge of my school, I'd disallow phone use during class but allow children to go on their phones during lunch/breakfast; I'd take in mind kids who focus better on independent work when listening to music. I wouldn't restrict educational games or websites, because I think children shouldn't be constantly struggling to find websites that aren't restricted when trying to do research projects. AI use will be fully banned because nobody knows how to use these tools correctly. These rules would make school better because it encourages an educational environment while also taking the kids in mind.

I asked the Ai to make an educational, in-depth quiz about medicinal knowledge and progression in the victorian era; I asked for it to be educational but aimed towards college-aged kids. It did the aesthetics of the quiz correctly however it wasn't very indepth nor seemed like it was actually aimed towards older teens/adults. I could improve on this by making my request more in-depth rather than just write a sentence or two. Being good at prompt engineering can be valuable for future careers because it helps people become more effective in using Ai and its intended purpose of it being a tool to help people in the workplace.

Some examples of technology that help people during natural disasters are EWS or early weather warning which is a system that detects and warns people of various threats (like natural disasters), this can help people prepare or evaculate in time to avoid a natural disaster. Various communication devices and news radios can also aid people during natural disasters. If I could invent a new piece of technology to assist people in natural disasters I'd make a device that both warns people of natural disasters, tells them about how long its gonna last, and redirects them towards fast evacuation routes or shelters in their area as well as what they might need during a disaster.

It's a big deal if SNAP runs out of funding because millions of people use SNAP to help them feed themselves and their family, without SNAP families in poverty will be unable to get that extra help. Technology could help people find places that are feeding people for free or buy food at a lower price than irl stores, Families can locate food banks or just organizations giving out food near them with technology. However, some people may be unable to afford internet or technology in general so technology won't benefit every single person who was previously relying on SNAP to help. If I was creating a tool to help food insecurity I'm not sure that I'd name it but I'd make it free (or atleast affordable) and It'd calculate just how much help someone would need and it'd give people money based on that as well as what they're buying and how much that would cost.

Self-driving cars may not recognize things like a stopped school bus because it's only paying attention to stop signs that are attached to the ground rather than one on a bus. Its likely that Self-driving cars are informed only of the basic laws of traffic (i.e. speed limits, traffic lights, etc.) and not things that are more obvious to us. The detector might fail in this situation due to the fact that the stop sign is attached to a car rather than on its own, they might not recognize that stop sign as a actual traffic sign as the programmers may have only put stop signs that aren't attached to anything in the cars database, causing it to miss ones that schoolbuses use. if I worked in Waymo, I'd enter obvious (or widely accepted) traffic rules into the car's databases and make sure they're following those new updates before I send them to drive in the real world.

This winter break I'm planning on visiting my family in kansas; we don't have any plans above just visiting and hanging out with my grandma and cousins, though me and my brother were considering going ice skating because theres a rink in wichita.

i used technology this winter break by using my phone the entire time. This break I used my phone and my laptop to read, play games, and watch videos. Throughout the break, I read books I'd downloaded on my phone, watched shows and movies I'd been meaning to watch but didn't have the time during school, and played games to pass the time.
