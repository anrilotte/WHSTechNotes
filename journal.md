I have mixed feelings on the cell phone law-- on one hand, it may help some students focus better which might lead to those students having better grades but it'll also lead to several issues with certain schoolwork because many students rely on their phones to do research for projects due to nearly every single site being restricted. For example, last year I did an english project on a topic that would've gotten flagged had I searched it on the computer so I had to do all the research on my phone lest I get pulled out of class like the other kids who picked the same project topic as me and tried to do their research on the chromebooks. The phone law, in my opinion, is pretty inutile in terms of actually helping students; It's likely it's going to just make students lives harder and force them to do all projects and research-based schoolwork fully at home.

Computer science can be valuable in the fashion industry by giving creators the ability to create 3D models of their design and helping them fully put their ideas to paper (or screen). The video shows designers being able to mix together clothing items from several different pictures to create one full outfit, this helps workers in fashion by giving them more creative ways to create designs. This could especially help people who aren't very good at coming up with an original design on the spot but are good at mix-matching and building off of other clothes- if they do that in fashion design?? In short, computer science can help designers and others in the fashion industry create designs easily and gives them a bit more creative freedom.

I don't think a virtual store where you can actually earn money is a very great idea. Social interaction is a core part of the human experienc; an actual job on a kids video game will likely limit peoples social well-being, especially if they treat it like an actual job and rarely every get out of their house. Jobs are where most peoples social interactions come from, while many of those are bad, people often make friends at their workplace you can't really do that on an online game (assuming it functions just as roblox does) There would be some interaction there but only via the roblox chat. In summary, A virtual story where you can actually recieve payment may not go extremely well as it'll affect peoples social interaction.

I don't know what 6,7 means; I heard people constantly shouting it, but I found it really annoying so I ignored it and didn't bother learning the actual meaning.

If i were in charge of my school, I'd disallow phone use during class but allow children to go on their phones during lunch/breakfast; I'd take in mind kids who focus better on independent work when listening to music. I wouldn't restrict educational games or websites, because I think children shouldn't be constantly struggling to find websites that aren't restricted when trying to do research projects. AI use will be fully banned because nobody knows how to use these tools correctly. These rules would make school better because it encourages an educational environment while also taking the kids in mind.

I asked the Ai to make an educational, in-depth quiz about medicinal knowledge and progression in the victorian era; I asked for it to be educational but aimed towards college-aged kids. It did the aesthetics of the quiz correctly however it wasn't very indepth nor seemed like it was actually aimed towards older teens/adults. I could improve on this by making my request more in-depth rather than just write a sentence or two. Being good at prompt engineering can be valuable for future careers because it helps people become more effective in using Ai and its intended purpose of it being a tool to help people in the workplace.
